WINDOWS BUILD NOTES
====================

Below are some notes on how to build Cheetahcoin Core for Windows.

Most developers use cross-compilation from Ubuntu to build executables for
Windows. This is also used to build the release binaries.

While there are potentially a number of ways to build on Windows (for example using msys / mingw-w64),
using x86_64 Ubuntu18.04 standalone or in docker container is the most straightforward. If you are on windows 10 machine,
WSL2 [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/about) on Ubuntu 18.04 os should also work. 


In a working x64 Ubuntu 18.04, you can follow the instructions below, starting
with the "Cross-compilation" section. Compiling the 64-bit version is
recommended but it is possible to compile the 32-bit version.

Cross-compilation
-------------------

These steps can be performed on, for example, an Ubuntu VM. The depends system
will also work on other Linux distributions, however the commands for
installing the toolchain will be different.

First, install the general dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config bsdmainutils curl

A host toolchain (`build-essential`) is necessary because some dependency
packages (such as `protobuf`) need to build host utilities that are used in the
build process.

## Building for 64-bit Windows

To build executables for Windows 64-bit, install the following dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 mingw-w64-x86-64-dev

Then build using:

    cd depends
    make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32
    cd ..
    ./autogen.sh # not required when building from tarball
    CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32/share/config.site ./configure --prefix=/  --disable-zmq  --disable-shared
    make

## Building for 32-bit Windows

To build executables for Windows 32-bit, install the following dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install g++-mingw-w64-i686 mingw-w64-i686-dev 

Then build using:

    cd depends
    make HOST=i686-w64-mingw32
    cd ..
    ./autogen.sh # not required when building from tarball
    CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/i686-w64-mingw32/share/config.site ./configure --prefix=/ --disable-zmq  --disable-shared
    make

## Depends system

For further documentation on the depends system see [README.md](../depends/README.md) in the depends directory.

Installation
-------------

After building using the Windows subsystem it can be useful to copy the compiled
executables to a directory on the windows drive in the same directory structure
as they appear in the release `.zip` archive. This can be done in the following
way. This will install to `c:\workspace\cheetahcoin`, for example:

    make install DESTDIR=/mnt/c/workspace/cheetahcoin
