For existing old NewEnglandcoin Wallet user

If you are existing NewEnglandcoin user, you can avoid long wallet syncing time by using old data files. You can perform 
below steps on your old wallet files for the v1.7.0 hard fork upgrade. 

Step 1 - Back up your existing wallet file. 
         Save the wallet file into somewhere. Use Qt wallet menu "File" -> "Backup Wallet" to do that. 

Step 2 - Rename your old data folder to new name. 
         Go to windows folder : 'C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\'. Note that you may need to enable windows hidden folder/files viewing options to see 'AppData' folder.
         Under Roaming folder, Rename "NewEnglandcoin" folder to "Nengcoin"
         Copy 'nengcoin.conf' to your path 'C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\Nengcoin'

Step 3 - Open up Nengcoin QT or CLI wallet, your old NENG coins should show up in the wallet.
