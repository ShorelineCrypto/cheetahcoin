What is Cheetahcoin?
----------------

Cheetahcoin is bitcoin's cat meme coin. Cheetahcoin is world first and only SHA256 coin minable on Android phones. 

Cheetahcoin forked solo mining and mobile mining technology from Nengcoin (NENG) on SHA256 using a proof-of-work algorithm with enhanced features to protect against 51% attack and decentralize on mining to allow diversified mining rigs across CPUs, GPUs, ASICs and Android phones.

Major releases features:

* v1.6.x Forked off Nengcoin randomSpike-v1.6.x  on SHA256 on top of bitcoin core v0.8.6
* v1.7.x New Logo, cheetah diff 4x, plus minor bitcoin core code updates
* v1.8.x cheetah diff 3x
* v1.9.x Fixed slow hack risk, cheetah diff rise 3x, spike drop 5x
* v1.10.x Changed bitcoin future timestamp 2 hour rule to 4 minute, cheetah/spike diff adjustment
* v2.1.0 rebased off bitcoin core v0.13.2 on v1.10.x randomSpike with 3 soft forks
* v2.3.0-1.12.x Future timestamp 30 seconds rule, cheetah diff drop to 1, 3 CSV BIPs enabled, Segwit BIPs Disabled

Current full version name: "v2.3.0._randomSpike-1.12.x" 
Note: All users/miners are recommended to use v2.3.0. Solo miners on USB ASIC/ASIC are no longer recommended to use v1.12.1 because of soft forks enforcement.
      Because now v2.3.0 are built with static linked wallet, macOS are fully supported (x86_64 wallet, but should work too for M1 chip).
